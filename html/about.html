          <h2>What is this Website</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
          This website is designed to provide a single account system where
          users can register their game and CTF scores, view leaderboards, and
          play with friends when multiplayer games are available. It serves as a
          hub for tracking progress and fostering friendly competition. Overall,
          this project is a personal endeavor aimed at learning new technologies
          while having fun along the way.

        </a>
        <p>
          Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions are a fun and engaging way to
          learn cybersecurity skills. Participants solve challenges that often
          involve cryptography, web security, reverse engineering, and more.
          CTFs are designed to be both educational and competitive, providing a
          platform to test your skills against others while learning new
          techniques. They are enjoyable because they combine problem-solving
          with teamwork and creativity, making them a productive way to enhance
          your technical abilities.
